        <div class="story__content">
          <p>
            In 2020, human boxers are replaced by <strong>robots</strong>. <i>Charlie Kenton</i>, a former boxer, owns one of these robots, called Ambush,
            but loses it in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner <i>Ricky</i>. Having bet with <i>Ricky</i> that Ambush
            would win, <i>Charlie</i>absconds before <i>Ricky</i> can collect.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the fight, <em>Charlie</em> learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must now attend a hearing deciding the future of
            their son, <i>Max</i>, a robot-boxing fan with whom <em>Charlie</em> has had virtually no contact since<em>Max</em> was born. Max's maternal
            aunt, <i>Debra</i>, and her wealthy husband, Marvin, want full custody, which <i>Charlie</i> bargains for <b>$100,000</b>, half in advance,
            and <i>Marvin</i> negotiates that <i>Charlie</i> retains <i>Max</i> for three months while <i>Marvin</i> and <i>Debra</i> go on vacation. Settling into a
            gym owned by <i>Bailey Tallet</i>, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, <i>Charlie</i> acquires the once-famous Noisy Boy,
            but it is destroyed in an underground match against another robot boxer, Midas. As <i>Charlie and Max</i> attempt to scavenge
            parts from a junkyard to make a new robot, Max discovers <ins><b>Atom</b></ins>, an obsolete but intact sparring robot designed to
            withstand severe damage, and can mirror opponent and handler movements and store them in its memory due to its rare
            "shadow function".
          </p>
          <p>
            At Max's behest, <i>Charlie</i> pits Atom against Metro, whom Atom overcomes.<i>Max</i> programs Noisy Boy's vocal-respond controls
            in Atom, and convinces <i>Charlie</i> to help him with Atom's fighting-move memory. This results in a series of victories,
            culminating in <i>Charlie</i> being offered a fight in World Robot Boxing, pitting Atom against national champion Twin Cities.
            The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive. <i>Charlie</i> notices a hitch whenever
            Twin Cities throws a right punch, and using this, <i>Charlie</i> controls Atom to a win by knockout. Elated by their success,
            Max challenges undefeated global champion Zeus, with the audience squarely on their side. After the fight, <i>Ricky</i>and his
            two henchmen attack <i>Charlie</i> for bailing earlier and rob him and <i>Max</i>of their winnings, prompting a defeated and dejected
            <i>Charlie</i> to return <i>Max</i> to <i>Debra</i>.
          </p>
          <p> 
            This upsets <i>Max</i>, and when <i>Charlie</i> tries to convince him that living without him is better for <i>Max</i>, <i>Max</i> says he always
            wanted <i>Charlie</i> to fight for him and be there as a father. After <i>Max</i> leaves, <i>Charlie</i> returns to Tallet's Gym. While
            talking with Bailey about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. <q>Persuaded by Bailey,
            <i>Charlie</i> arranges the Zeus challenge Max wanted and convinces Debra to allow <i>Max</i>to witness the fight.</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            Zeus dominates early, knocking Atom down with its first punch; Atom continues to get back up despite Zeus's punishment.
            Atom survives the first round, stunning the audience. <i>Ricky</i>, who had made a <b>$100,000</b> bet with <i>Finn</i>, a friend of
            Charlie's, that Atom would not last the first round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by the fight's bookmakers.
            Meanwhile, in the ring, Atom lands multiple punches but continues to be knocked down repeatedly. Late in the fourth
            round, Atom's vocal-respond controls are damaged, forcing <i>Charlie</i> to use its shadow function to make Atom mimic his
            boxing skills. Atom endures a long series of attacks from Zeus until Zeus's power cores have been depleted, at which
            point <i>Charlie</i> directs Atom to begin its counterattack against a tired and helpless Zeus. With Zeus's programmers unable
            to compensate, the designer, Tak Mashido, personally takes control like <i>Charlie</i> has. Zeus is given a sound beating, once
            even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout, but wins the match by number of hits since Atom could
            not beat it within the limit of five rounds. <del>Atom</del> Zeus remains undefeated, but with Mashido's group left humiliated by the
            near-loss and Zeus damaged to the point where he's irreparable and permanently shut down, <mark>Atom is triumphantly labeled
            the people's champion</mark> as <i>Max</i> and <i>Charlie</i> celebrate regardless of the match result.
